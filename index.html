    beneath the oceam they roam, wja;es majestic giants.in their watery blue home. Their songs, a symphony, echo through the deep blue, tales of the oceans in melodies they keep, In waters deep, where the sunlight is dim, gentle movements, like gentelle refrains. The mejestic spouts rise, a breae in the air, a Dance of big giants cant even compare.
